// servo PWM module
// basically, you have a major period, which is approx. 20 ms (50Hz)
// and then a pulse, which has a tmin ~ 1ms duration
// and a tmax ~ 2ms duration
// and you want to subdivide the pulse by some number of ticks

// we have a 26 MHz clock available which should theoretically give 
// us 38ns resolution if this is done right.

// let's assume the 26 MHz clock is a given, fixed, and invariant.
//
// first, we need to have a mechanism to tell us when 20 ms has passed.
// when that has passed, we then want to count out a period of time
// which corresponds to tmin + pwmval * delta, 
// where pwmval * delta < (tmax - tmin)
